# 2.Getting Started with Arduino

## **2.1 What is Arduino?**

Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. Arduino boards are able to read inputs - light on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter message - and turn it into an output - activating a motor, turning on an LED, publishing something online. You can tell your board what to do by writing the program code in the IDE and sending the instructions to the microcontroller on the board. To do so you use the Arduino programming language (based on Wiring), and the Arduino Software (IDE), based on Processing.

## **2.2 Installing the Arduino IDE for Windows**

Visit <https://www.arduino.cc/en/software> to download the latest Arduino IDE version for your computer’s operating system. There are versions for Windows, Mac, and Linux systems.

**The Arduino IDE 2**

The Arduino IDE 2 is a big step from its sturdy predecessor, Arduino IDE 1.x, and comes with revamped UI, improved board & library manager, debugger, autocomplete feature and much more.

Here we will show how to download and install the Arduino IDE 2.2.1 on your Windows

You can choose between the Installer (.exe) and the Zip packages. We suggest you use the first one that installs directly everything you need to use the Arduino Software (IDE), including the drivers. With the Zip package you need to install the drivers manually. The Zip file is also useful if you want to create a [portable installation](https://arduino.cc/en/Guide/PortableIDE).

## 2.4 Select Board and Port in Arduino IDE

![](media/9719a62c6ebf40346819de383b90d86c.png)

Before uploading code to the connected control board, we need to select board and port in Arduino IDE.

Two methods are introduced below:

1. Using the Board and Port selector of the Tool drop-down list

2. Using the board selector

## 2.5 Add Libraries to Arduino IDE

**Why Use Libraries?**

Libraries are incredibly useful when creating a project of any type. They make our development experience much smoother, and there almost an infinite amount out there. They are used to interface with many different sensors, RTCs, Wi-Fi modules, RGB matrices and of course with other components on your board.

**Including a Library in the sketch**

![](media/04646b12f83ae55602cd7e186850034c.png)

![](media/79939cc2b0037a52ce8b7571cb448699.png)![](media/067e9b7efcc117f4dd702c49f66f1735.png)

**Two ways to add libraries to Arduino IDE**

1.**Method One: Importing a .zip Library**

![](media/68b46d43a6912da4b010ae4c37cc496e.png)

![](media/3eb07bb12bf9ada902326970dc7a455a.png)

![](media/0713a4d4dc9e43f97ffb5175bc094c96.jpeg)

2.**Method Two: Manual Installation**

The default location where Arduino sketches you write will be saved is called the Sketchbook. The Sketchbook is simply a folder on your computer like any other. It acts as a handy repository for sketches and is also where add-on code libraries get saved.

**Libraries Folder**

The **sketchbook\\libraries** folder is the default location where libraries are installed to from the Arduino IDE.

If you want to add a library manually, the library file cannot be added as a zip file, you need to unzip it and put it in the **libraries** folder of your sketchbook by yourself.

![](media/54ed3cb6b4303dfb851d49ec6c998256.jpeg)

![](media/4dde6298b58678953a4f0e8cb09229cc.jpeg)

![](media/28fdb140904c915c2b37ba02923a68f6.png)

Uninstalling an Arduino Library

Uninstalling an Arduino Library is simpler than installing it. Find the sketchbook folder on your computer (same as in the “Manually installing a library” chapter). Go to the location and open the “libraries” folder. Select the folder containing the library you want to delete, and then simply delete it. Next time you open your Arduino IDE, there won’t be the deleted library under the Sketch > Include Library menu.

![](media/7a7fc5fc95be160fe7f9aa50be140f6d.png)

Libraries don’t take much space and most of the time there is no reason to remove them. If you don’t intend to use them again, though, and want to declutter the list, you can safely delete them. You can always install any Arduino Library again if you need to use it in the future.

## Lesson 1.1: LED Blinks

**(1).Description：**

LED, the abbreviation of light emitting diodes consists of Ga, As, P, N chemical compounds, and so on. The LED can flash in diverse colors by altering the delay time in the test code. When in control, power on GND and VCC, the LED will be on if the S end is at a high level; nevertheless, it will go off.

pinMode(LED，OUTPUT) - This function can denote that the pin is INPUT or OUTPUT

digitalWrite(LED，HIGH) - When pin is OUTPUT, we can set it to HIGH(output 5V) or LOW(output 0V)

## Lesson 1.2: Changing the blinking frequency of the LED

**>>>>>>>>This lesson is an expansion of the Lesson 1.1**

![](media/dc02634b4874771998403f117ee1d947.png)

![](media/f0de183159df3ae4da64e532823f46ea.png)

## Lesson 2.1: Adjust the Brightness of the LED

Hardware required for this lesson, the configuration of the arduino IDE, and the wiring between the LDE module and the control board is in the same way as **Lesson 1.1**.

**(1).Description：**

In previous lesson, we control LED on and off and make it blink.

In this project, we will control LED brightness through PWM to simulate breathing effect. Similarly, you can change the step length and delay time in the code so as to demonstrate different breathing effect.

![](media/d1f48d97cbe0b6a29389c20533bfc00c.png)PWM is a means of controlling the analog output via digital means. Digital control is used to generate square waves with different duty cycles (a signal that constantly switches between high and low levels) to control the analog output.In general, the input voltage of port are 0V and 5V. What if the 3V is required? Or what if switch among 1V, 3V and 3.5V? We can’t change resistor constantly. For this situation, we need to control by PWM.

For the Arduino digital port voltage output, there are only LOW and HIGH, which correspond to the voltage output of 0V and 5V. You can define LOW as 0 and HIGH as 1, and let the Arduino output five hundred 0 or 1 signals within 1 second.

If output five hundred 1, that is 5V; if all of which is 1, that is 0V. If output 010101010101 in this way then the output port is 2.5V, which is like showing movie. The movie we watch are not completely continuous. It actually outputs 25 pictures per second. In this case, the human can’t tell it, neither does PWM. If want different voltage, need to control the ratio of 0 and 1. The more 0,1 signals output per unit time, the more accurately control.

![](media/9ce4c120ad6d763102eb2544777c8536.png)

![](media/fa2a60fcb812e3bb3a4776ac96bef1cb.png)

**(2).Code Explanation:**

When we need to repeat some statements, we could use FOR statement.

FOR statement format is shown below:

![](media/f413519de8de75a850c98ac7695300fa.jpeg)

FOR cyclic sequence:

Round 1：1 → 2 → 3 → 4

Round 2：2 → 3 → 4

…

Until number 2 is not established, “for”loop is over,

After knowing this order, go back to code:

for (int value = 0; value \< 255; value=value+1){

…}

for (int value = 255; value >0; value=value-1){

…}

The two“for”statements make value increase from 0 to 255, then reduce from 255 to 0, then increase to 255,….infinitely loop

There is a new function in the following —– analogWrite()

We know that digital port only has two state of 0 and 1. So how to send an analog value to a digital value? Here,this function is needed. Let’s observe the Arduino board and find 6 pins marked“\~”which can output PWM signals.

Function format as follows:

analogWrite(pin,value)

analogWrite() is used to write an analog value from 0\~255 for PWM port, so the value is in the range of 0\~255. Attention that you only write the digital pins with PWM function, such as pin 2 , 3，4 , 5，6，7 , 8 , 9，10，11 , 12 , 13 , 44, 45 , 46.

PWM is a technology to obtain analog quantity through digital method. Digital control forms a square wave, and the square wave signal only has two states of turning on and off (that is, high or low levels). By controlling the ratio of the duration of turning on and off, a voltage varying from 0 to 5V can be simulated. The time turning on(academically referred to as high level) is called pulse width, so PWM is also called pulse width modulation.

Through the following five square waves, let’s acknowledge more about PWM.

![](media/7c9452d3bb97cfee514ef146045866a8.png)

In the above figure, the green line represents a period, and value of analogWrite() corresponds to a percentage which is called Duty Cycle as well. Duty cycle implies that high-level duration is divided by low-level duration in a cycle. From top to bottom, the duty cycle of first square wave is 0% and its corresponding value is 0. The LED brightness is lowest, that is, turn off. The more time high level lasts, the brighter the LED. Therefore, the last duty cycle is 100%, which correspond to 255, LED is brightest. 25% means darker.

PWM mostly is used for adjusting the LED brightness or rotation speed of motor.

It plays vital role in controlling smart robot car.

## Lesson 2.2: Slow down the change of the brightness of the LED

**>>>>>>>>This lesson is an expansion of the Lesson 2.1**

Hardware required for this lesson, the configuration of the arduino IDE, and the wiring between the LDE module and the control board is in the same way as **Lesson 1.1**.

There are prolific interactive works completed by Arduino. The most common one is sound and light display. We always use LED to make experiments. For this lesson, we design circuit to emit sound. The universal sound components are buzzer and horns. Buzzer is easier to use. And buzzer includes about active buzzer and passive buzzer. In this experiment, we adopt passive buzzer.

While using passive buzzer, we can control different sound by inputting square waves with distinct frequency. During the experiment, we control code to make buzzer sound, begin with “tick, tick” sound, then make passive buzzer emit “do re mi fa so la si do”, and play specific songs.

## Lesson 6: Photosensitive Sensor

**(1)Description**

There are four photoresistor sensor modules in this kit, the ambient light sensors, with photoresistor as main component.

The resistance of a photoresistor varies with the light intensity. When there is light around, its resistance ranges in 5-10KΩ; while when it is dark, the resistance is only 0.2MΩ. Based on this property, a circuit can be built to convert the change in resistance to changes in voltage.

What’s more, the sensor comes with an anti-reverse insertion terminal with a pitch of 2.54mm to facilitate the wiring. It is also compatible with many kinds of microcontrollers, such the Arduino microcontroller series.

Here, we apply this sensor with the Arduino microcontroller. The S (signal) end of the sensor should be input to the analog pin of Arduino to detect the variation in analog value which will be printed on the serial monitor.

## Lesson 8: BH1750 Digital Light Intensity Module

**(1)Description:**

![](media/53ab41d84e93814e57076a8cc25e1aa7.png)

The main component of this sensor is chip BH1750FVI which is an integrated chip for digital light intensity.

As shown in the picture below, BH1750 is composed of a photodiode, an operational amplifier, an ADC acquisition, a crystal oscillator, etc. The photodiode converts the input optical signal into an electrical signal through the photovoltaic effect. After being amplified by the operational amplifier circuit, the voltage is collected by the ADC, and then converted into a 16-bit binary number through the logic circuit and stored in the internal register(Note: The stronger the light, the greater the photocurrent, and the greater the voltage, so the intensity of the light can be judged by the value of the voltage.

However, it should be noted that the voltage and the light intensity are one-to-one correspondence, but not proportional. That is why this chip linear processing is done and why the integrated IC is used directly instead of photodiodes). BH1750 leads out the clock line and data line. The single-chip microcomputer can communicate with the BH1750 module through the I2C protocol. You can choose the working mode of the BH1750, or you can extract the illuminance data of the BH1750 register.

**(2)Parameters:**

The output is Illuminance

Measuring range is 1\~65535 lux, the minimum resolution is 1lux

Low power consumption (Power down) function

## Lesson 9: Test the Servo Motor

![](media/1e72f94dd8103419a46dded6b2969706.png)

**(1)Description：**

Servo motor is a position control rotary actuator. It mainly consists of housing, circuit board, core-less motor, gear and position sensor. Its working principle is that the servo receives the signal sent by MCU or receiver, and produces a reference signal with a period of 20ms and width of 1.5ms, then compares the acquired DC bias voltage to the voltage of the potentiometer and obtains the voltage difference output.

![](media/69be958142b773acdae33eeef12afed7.png)

For the servo used in this project, the brown wire is the ground, the red one is the positive wire, and the orange one is the signal wire.

The rotation angle of servo motor is controlled by regulating the duty cycle of PWM (Pulse-Width Modulation) signal. The standard cycle of PWM signal is 20ms(50Hz). Theoretically, the width is distributed between 1ms-2ms, but in fact,it’s between 0.5ms-2.5ms. The width corresponds to the rotation angle from 0° to 180°. But note that for different brand motor, the same signal may have different rotation angle.

![](media/901cdf76ced95e24e2dc2a43441bb76f.png)

Solar panels are not batteries, do not have the function of power storage. It can store electricity in the batter.

The output of solar panels is weak in environments where there is no sunlight, indoor lighting and low winter light. The energy carried by these lights is very small, even if it is brighter.

**Note:**

The solar panel may require long periods of direct sunlight to charge the batteries enough. 18650 batteries should not be exposed to direct sunlight as well as avoiding high temperatures around it to avoid burnout.

**Note:**

1).The charging protocol of phone charging Module only supports Android but not iOS.

2).The solar panel can't charge mobile phones directly; it need to store electricity in a battery and the battery charge the phone.

3).The voltage of the 18650 battery needs to be in the range of 3.2---4.2V to charge the cell phone. When the voltage of the battery is less than 3.2V, even though the phone shows that it is charging, it is not actually charging.

4).The solar panel may require long periods of direct sunlight to charge the batteries enough. 18650 batteries should not be exposed to direct sunlight as well as avoiding high temperatures around it to avoid burnout.

5).If you want to charge your 18650 battery quickly, you can charge the battery using the 18650 dedicated charger. Or use a USB 2.0 to micro USB cable to connect the charging module and charge the battery using a computer or power supply. (USB 2.0 to micro USB cable not included in kit)

6).This is just a simulation experiment and will not meet your daily power needs, don't use it as your regular cell phone power source.

# Lesson 11: Solar Panel Device with Multiply Functions

The assembled solar panel device is ready!

In the previous lessons, we only studied the function and working principle of a certain electronic part individually, and tested whether it can work normally.

Now we have them working together to build a solar panel device with multiple functions.

Keep the 18650 battery charged enough as it will be needed to power two servos, an LCD display, four light sensors, a DHT11 sensor and button module.

![](media/f4b78ac6371097b2e32409c226873651.png)

![](media/94d386c19c8b95904852ee2a11a4f272.png)

After the code is uploaded successfully, turn on the power switch of the charging module and press the power switch of the control board to 5V.

![](media/edc80fe0bd7a1cce69bd760ab5d247bc.png)![](media/67fc5cb5b7eabda71fcb2296a8def597.png)

The servo will rotate to the initial angle. When the ambient light sensor detects changes in light intensity, servos rotate the solar panel to the position where the light is the strongest and LCD1602 shows the value of the light intensity and temperature and humidity detected by the BH1750 and XHT11 respectively.

If you feel that the solar panel rotates too slowly or the solar panel shakes, you can adjust the rotation speed of the servo through the button module.

For example, within the specified time, the servo rotates 1° each time. After pressing the button, the servo will rotate 2° each time within the same time.

Press it again and the servo will rotate 3° each time in the same time. By analogy, the servo can be adjusted to rotate up to 5° each time in the same time.

**“byte m_speed = 10”**

You can also change this code to set the delay time to adjust the speed of the servo; the longer the time, the smaller the speed.

(1)**The control board is not recognized by the computer.**

-Please check if the USB cable is good and your computer's USB port is available.

(2)**USB port can’t recognized by computer.**

-Check if you have installed the USB driver

(3)**Code problems/Failed uploading/Code error.**

These reasons can cause problems with your code:

1) The driver is not installed.

2) The board type and COM port are not selected correctly in the Arduino IDE.

3) The library file is not installed.

(Please follow **2.Getting Started with Arduino** to troubleshoot the above problems)

![](media/224c21b5aa737f11de351dbd9868e317.png)

(4)Poor USB contact

If you don’t have the problems in 1-3 above, check that the USB cable connection is good, try re-plugging it, and then upload the code again.

(5)**The assembled Solar tracking kit doesn’t respond.**

1)These reasons may cause the robot not to work:

1)wrong wiring

2)You didn't upload the code

3)Failed uploading/Code error

4)You didn't turn on the 5V switch on the control board and the power switch on the charging module.

![](media/67fc5cb5b7eabda71fcb2296a8def597.png)![](media/edc80fe0bd7a1cce69bd760ab5d247bc.png)

5)Insufficient battery power

You need to keep the 18650 battery charged enough as it will be needed to power two servos, an LCD display, four light sensors, a DHT11 sensor and button module.

(6)**Servo stuck/servo hot**

You will need to adjust the initial angle of the servo before assembling them and not change the angle until assembly is complete to ensure that the servo operates properly for solar tracking kit.

(7)**The solar panel does not track the movement of the light source or the sun**

When the ambient light sensor detects changes in light intensity, servos rotate the solar panel to the position where the light is the strongest.

In an environment with uniform lighting, the solar panel may not track the movement of the light source. You may need to apply a very strong light source, or apply a light source in a weak light area to make the solar panel move with the light source. The solar panel may not move toward the sun because the difference in light intensity detected by each ambient light sensor may not be large.

1.  **The solar panel moves very slowly, jerks or gets stuck.**
2.  Check that the servo wiring is organised and not jammed so that the servo can have enough room to move.
3.  18650 battery needs to be fully charged
4.  You can press the button module to adjust the amount of servo rotation.
